/**
 * The Deck class represents a collection of all possible cards in a deck of playing cards. A standard
 * deck contains 52 cards and does not contain Jokers. The default constructor creates a single deck.
 * An overloaded constructor provides the ability to create more than one deck at instantiation. This
 * class provides means to shuffle the deck one or more times. The deck will also know if it has been
 * shuffled. The deck can also be cleared and repopulated. Purposely there are no methods which allow
 * cards to be added to the deck. Cards may be removed but never added. An unmodifiable collection
 * is returned when requested.
